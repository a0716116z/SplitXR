Thank you for purchasing PBR Temple pack!


The temple pieces are modular and will allow you to create many variations.

There is a prefab folder where you can find the assets, with lod's, static and lightmap enabled.

The trees are compatible with the terrain and are already setups with lod's and colliders.
